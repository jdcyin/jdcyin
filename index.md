I'm a Ph.D. student in Public Health, at The University of Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, School of Public Health. My academic interests centre around integrating new data types -- social media, traditional media, <i>i.e.</i> social data -- for public health research; a growing field known as <i>infodemiology</i>. Currently, I analyse social networks to identify spread of misinformation. My supervisors are Professor Gabriel M. Leung and Dr. Karen A. Gr√©pin.

Outside of academia, I travel, camp, coasteer (coastal hiking), learn languages, rollerblade, and try new things. Check out the <b><a href="https://jdcyin.github.io/projects">Personal Projects</a></b> tab on the left.
