I'm currently an analyst at <b><a href="https://impact.economist.com/">The Economist</a></b> in their health practice.

<p style="padding: 10px;">I previously did my Ph.D. in Public Health, the School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong in the field of infodemiology. I was supervised by Professors Gabriel M. Leung and Karen A. Gr√©pin. Please see the <b><a href="https://jasonyin.com/academics">Academics</a></b> tab for my work. </p>


<p style="padding: 10px;">I also travel, camp, coasteer (coastal hiking), learn languages, rollerblade, and try new things. Check out the <b><a href="https://jasonyin.com/projects">Personal Projects</a></b> tab on the left.
