I am a Ph.D. student in Public Health, studying at The University of Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, School of Public Health. My academic interests centre around using and integrating new data types -- social media, traditional media, <i>i.e.</i> social data -- for public health research. This is part of a growing field known as <i>digital epidemiology</i>. My current work uses computational analysis of traditional media to measure risk perception, in addition to how social networks impact disease trajectories. I am supervised by Professor Gabriel M. Leung.

In addition to the work in digital epidemiology, I also collaborate with other researchers on public health-related research. A few of my recent projects are accessible

Outside of academia, I like to travel, camp, coasteer (coastal hiking), learn languages, rollerblade, and try my hand at some new stuff. Some examples of the aforementioned are below.
