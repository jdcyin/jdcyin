I am a Ph.D. student in Public Health, studying at The University of Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, School of Public Health. My academic interests centre around using and integrating social media to understand issues in public health -- a growing field known as <i>infodemiology</i>. My supervisor is Professor Gabriel M. Leung. In addition to the work on infodemiology, I also collaborate with other universities on COVID-19 related research. A few of my recent projects are accessible through the link on the left.

Outside of academia, I like to travel, camp, coasteer (coastal hiking), learn languages, <b>rollerblade</b>, and try my hand at some new stuff. Some examples of the aforementioned are below.
