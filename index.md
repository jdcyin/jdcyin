I'm currently an analyst at <a href="https://impact.economist.com/">The Economist</a> in their health practice.

<p>
I previously did my Ph.D. in Public Health, the School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong in the field of infodemiology. I was supervised by Professors Gabriel M. Leung and Karen A. Gr√©pin. Please see the <a href="https://jasonyin.com/academics">Academics</a> tab for my work.

I also travel, camp, coasteer (coastal hiking), learn languages, rollerblade, and try new things. Check out the <b><a href="https://jasonyin.com/projects">Personal Projects</a></b> tab on the left.
