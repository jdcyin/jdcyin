I am a Ph.D. student in Public Health, studying at The University of Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, School of Public Health. My academic interests centre around using and integrating social media to understand issues in public health -- a growing field known as <i>infodemiology</i>. My supervisor is Professor Gabriel M. Leung. 

In my spare time, I like to camp, coasteer (coastal hiking), learn languages, and rollerblade.


## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.

After you've familiarized yourself with Hydejack, you can delete the following folders and files
containing example content:
