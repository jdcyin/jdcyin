I am a Ph.D. student in Public Health, studying at The University of Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, School of Public Health. My academic interests centre around using and integrating social media to understand issues in public health -- a growing field known as <i>infodemiology</i>. My supervisor is Professor Gabriel M. Leung. 

In my spare time, I like to camp, coasteer (coastal hiking), learn languages, and rollerblade.
